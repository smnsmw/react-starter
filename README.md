# react-starter

Just minimal setup for react project

It should have

1. Typescript
2. Sass
3. HMR
4. Storybook (typescript sass support)
5. Dev server with easy ability to mock server requests
6. Jest
7. Linter, code-formatter, pre-commit pre-push hooks


Why not create-react-app?

Well, the main point of the project is to create clear and small project for my needs, which I clearly understand from start to the end, which I also able to extend quickly at any point with whatever plugin I want, aand also I don't want messing with swelled config many part of which I in fact don't need.
